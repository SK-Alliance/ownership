# 🔧 **Supabase Client-Side Error Fix**

## ❌ **Problem Identified**
```
Error: supabaseKey is required.
    at user-management.ts:6:30
```

The error occurred because:
1. **Server-side key on client**: The `user-management.ts` file was trying to initialize a Supabase client with `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` on the client-side
2. **Security violation**: Service role keys should NEVER be exposed to the browser
3. **Import chain issue**: Client-side components were importing server-side database operations

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Created Server-Side API Endpoint**
- **File**: `src/app/api/users/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Handle user management operations safely on the server
- **Methods**:
  - `POST`: Create or get user by wallet address
  - `GET`: Fetch user by wallet address
- **Security**: Uses service role key safely on server-side only

### **2. Refactored Client-Side Functions**
- **File**: `src/lib/user-management.ts` (updated)
- **Changes**:
  - Removed Supabase client initialization
  - Updated functions to use fetch API calls to `/api/users`
  - Maintained same function signatures for compatibility
  - Added proper error handling and type safety

### **3. Added Safe Client Utility**
- **File**: `src/lib/supabase-client.ts` (new)
- **Purpose**: Provides safe client-side Supabase access using anon key
- **Usage**: For any future client-side database operations

## 🔄 **Architecture Changes**

### **Before (❌ Broken)**
```
Client Component → user-management.ts → Supabase (SERVICE_ROLE_KEY) ❌
```

### **After (✅ Fixed)**
```
Client Component → user-management.ts → API Route → Supabase (SERVICE_ROLE_KEY) ✅
```

## 🛡️ **Security Improvements**

1. **Service Role Key**: Now only used server-side where it's safe
2. **API Layer**: Added proper validation and error handling
3. **Client Safety**: Client-side code only uses public anon key when needed
4. **Type Safety**: Maintained full TypeScript support throughout

## 📋 **Files Changed**

1. ✅ `src/app/api/users/route.ts` - New API endpoint for user management
2. ✅ `src/lib/user-management.ts` - Refactored to use API calls
3. ✅ `src/lib/supabase-client.ts` - Safe client-side Supabase utility
4. ✅ Environment variables verified in `.env`

## 🧪 **Testing Status**

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ Development server: Running successfully  
- ✅ Import chain: Fixed and safe
- ✅ Function compatibility: Maintained existing interfaces
- ✅ Error handling: Improved with proper API responses

## 🎯 **Result**

The `/mint` page should now load without the `supabaseKey is required` error. All user management operations will work through the secure API layer while maintaining the same functionality for the minting process.

**Next Steps:**
1. Test the mint page - error should be resolved
2. Test the dashboard - minted NFTs section should work
3. Test user creation during minting process
4. Verify database operations work correctly

The fix is **clean, secure, and optimal** as requested! 🚀
